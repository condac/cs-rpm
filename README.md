Cities Skylines Realistic Power Mod

#  About
The game creators have a vary strange stance to favor solar power so much that the best power plan based on all factors is always the solar power. This takes out all realism and any gameplay where you want to build up to something better over time as your city grows. There is no real punish for using coal or oil from a pollution standpoint in the game. There is no reason to use hydroplants because they are the most expensive per MW in the game, as in real life they are the cheapest. There is so many things that are wrong with the powerplants and the games dynamic around the gameplay that it makes me sad. 

# Design rules
Because the game has no power banks or any good way to handle variating power loads, all power plants numbers are based on real life year average and output a constant power. Most data is taken from Sweden and Finnland ( I live there and these are very hydro, wind and nuclear based countries and the game developers are from Finnland so one would think they have used data from there own country). 

Also there is a need to keep the game progress fun so there must be small cheap alternatives early game. This is a reason to the size of the coal power beeing a bit smaller but cost factors should be realistic. 

# Powerplants reallife comparision
Here is the list of the powerplants in the game and whats wrong with them compared to real life...

Lots of data is just straight from wikipedia where there is no reason do doubt the technical validity of the data. 

## Basic Wind Turbine

Wind data is based on wind tubines in Sweden duing 2014 and 2018. The average installed size between these dates is 3.45 MW per turbine. During the year the average power production is 25% of the installed power capacity. This makes each plant around 0.86MW.  The manufacturers claim that 2018 was not a normal wind year so the productivity is expected to be around 30% so for simplicity we round the numbers to 1MW. 

The scale of the drawn asset compared to real life and the space allowed between looks realistic so no scale modifier is used. 

So this one is easy to make a final result of 1MW per plant.
